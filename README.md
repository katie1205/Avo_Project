# Avo_Project

This project is a time series analysis of weekly :avocado: sales in Houston, TX. The goal of the project was to apply the 
Box-Jenkins method to:
+ assess stationarity of the series + + if nonstationary, transform series to stationarize (if possible)
+ identify any suitable models, if they exist
+ + fit candidate models & assess model performance
+ + select optimal model and apply it to forecast new observations
