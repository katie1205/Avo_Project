# Avocados :avocado:
This project was a time series analysis of weekly :avocado: sales in Houston, TX. The goal of the project was to apply the 
Box-Jenkins method to:
+ Assess stationarity of the series 
  + if nonstationary, transform series to stationarize (if possible)
+ Identify any suitable models, if they exist
  + fit candidate models & assess model performance
  + select optimal model and apply it to forecast new observations
